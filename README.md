it then lets you quickly search either search engine easily through the terminal.

```
or

```
*I'm using python 3 there.

## TODO:
 - Want to make an alias so this can be used from anywhere while on terminal
 - Validating bad search engines 
 - tests

This is a very early version of work in progress, if you feel like you're having some cool ideas how to make this be better feel free to jump in.
